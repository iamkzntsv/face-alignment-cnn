# Face Alignment using Convolutional Neural Network

Facial landmark detection acts as a fundamental part of many computer vision applications. It is commonly used for tasks such as facial expression analysis and real-time face tracking, so it needs to be as accurate and fast as possible. Common approaches \cite{cao2014face, kazemi2014one} suggest training a cascade of regression trees using gradient boosting algorithm and pixel intensity differences as features. Alternatively, this problem can be approached using neural networks, which is the focus of this project.
